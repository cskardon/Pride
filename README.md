# Our Pride is open source

In 2022, we open-sourced our [Pride flag design](https://github.com/microsoft/Pride-flag) representing 40 LGBTQIA+ communities. Since then, we’ve continued to grow our expression. Our 2025 update reflects 74 identities, and includes new asset types. This Pride, LGBTQIA+ people at Microsoft invite you to make these designs your own and forge the bonds of friendship, allyship, and support.
