# Our Pride is open source

Last year, we open-sourced our [Pride flag design](https://github.com/microsoft/Pride-flag) representing 40 LGBTQIA+ communities. Our latest update reflects almost 50 identities and comes with new layouts. Plus, we are open-sourcing the entire Pride design and invite you to remix, share and make more Pride.

# An emblem of unity

Created by the LGBTQIA+ people at Microsoft and with our partners, this expression celebrates the nuance, intersectionality, and strength of LGBTQIA+ communities by bringing together almost 50 community flags in immersive and evocative designs. The hand-drawn brush strokes and sketch textures that make up LGBTQIA+ flags spark creativity and inspire action–encouraging everyone to make and expand Pride.
